Lal Kitab is based on Vedic Jyotish or also called as Parasher Jyotish.

There is no concept of different lagnas as every kundli is a Kalpurush kundli, i.e., with Mesh Lagna [[rashi-names-hindi-english]] [[rashi-mesh-aries]][[kalpurush-kundli]]

First chart out the regular lagna kundli [[lagna-ascendant]] and place all the 9 planets in the houses [[bhaav-houses]] in the same house where they are present in the regular kundli.

The most important planet to consider as per Lal Kitab is the guru - Jupiter. [Jupiter Guru](https://link)
