Everywhere in Lal Kitab, two things are given - Precautions and Remedies.

In Lal Kitab -

### **Precautions**

Do not donate for education
Do not walk barefoot on patterns, like carpets.

### **Remedies**

Put **7** silver square pieces in Neem tree. **Someone may steal it, but still you get the results of your karma**
Your wife should wear a silver bangle with Red color (work) on it.

### **Notes**

The Lal Kitab is using the principles of **activation** here. The 9th House is 3rd from the 7th House which is the place for your wife, so this means the hands of your wife, thus it makes sure that you donate silver to your wife, and putting Mars on it.

Even with the Neem tree, Neem is again Mars, it is asking you to put square silver **7** pieces on it, 
thus activating the Moon and Mars over there, thus giving help to and thus activating Venus.

Another remedy Lal Kitab is - 9th House is the House of Bhagya, thus 9th House Shukra is your luck and if you are giving money for education, and Venus is education, you are going to suffer in your luck,as you are giving away part of your luck.

**The best remedy for Venus in the 9th House is, depending on which particular sign - raashi in which it is placed,**
you use that activation, like, if someone has exalted Venus in 9th House, like in Pisces, donate bed for old people, why old people, because Venus is in a nakshatra of Saturn, Purva Bhadrapada.
I am using Nakshatras in Lal Kitab Remedies.
These are the missing links of Lal Kitab.
**How do you find what you should donate and what you should not, because Lal Kitab is also stopping you from donating some other items**
**Lal Kitab is stopping you frm donating anything which controls your Bhagya, like one of the redies of Venus is make your wife happy, because that is how your Bhagya will rise, Venus in 9th House, your Bhagya will rise after marriage, because you are activatin a planet which is in Bhagya sthaan, but suppose you start donating things of Venus, like clothes, your clothes, especially your old clothes, you atart donating perfume to the people, anything which signifies Venus, so anything which is in your Bhagyasthaan, is not donated as a remedy.**
**Because if you stop at the sign-raashi level only, that's half remedy. But if you want to see the magic of Lal Kitab, use signs - raashis in it, use nakshatras in it**

What if **parivartana** is there - doesn't matter because Lal Kitab does not talk at all about **Parivartan** at all.
**Go beyond these remedies and precautions, see why it is happening, and then use them**

## Venus in Aries in 9th house

? Wife short tempered
Easy affairs, easy relationships actually because Venus is about relationships in general, not only affairs
Because Venus in a sign of Mars, it has all the energy needed to make and break multiple relationships.
Aries is very **hot** sign.
Volatile relationships.
Fed up or fight with wife and religious places or related to father.
Transformation at the age of 21.
**What should be the remedy for this - waht should we donate to calm down this Venus**
**Which nakshatra it is?**
**The best remedy is do not visit the temple with the husband**
This person will get ery angry when people tell him anything about religion, because Venus signifies how you do your daily pooja, how you conduct your rituals, so whenever someone tells him about any suggestion about these matters, he will get very angry and start a fight then and there, because he or she has a particular relationship with Gos, about which he is not ready to discuss or debate or be questioned.
**Donate flag of XXX and Ketu nakshatra - wonderful remedy**
Mother can have uterine problems,or married life of mother is not good, because she has Venus in Aries in her 6th house.
**Ketu or Mars in 7th house means the marriage is not so good, but from the wife's side, it looks good, so how come this disparity?, because the person with Rahu has his upper hand, so he will not be complaining, the the one with Ketu or Mars will always be complaining**
**How to see life changing accidents in life chart? Use KaalChakraDasha, whenever there is a quantum jump, something big is about to happen**

First use:

- the Natal chart - raashi and then 3 parameters
- KaalChakraDasha
- Dwadansh - D12 - as D1 is not reliable in advanced predictions, it is good enough only for basic predictions **this is very accurate**
- Trishansh
- Shashthyansh D60 - **the most accurate one, e.g., Venus in the Shashthyansh is in Rakshas one so we know how his wife really is** 

For Ravan Samhita, only Navansh.
**Ketu is isolation, people with prominent do not want to meet anyone, wherever *your* ketu is, and when you deal yourself with that particular area where ketu is,*you are going to harm that area of your own*, headless warrior that the Ketu is, , what you should instead is, wherever your Ketu is, you should put someone in front, like a dog protecting a house.**
**KaalChakraDasha is very simple, you already know the signs, the only thing you need to know is how the dashas are jumping, dogs are related**
**So when you are dealing with Ketu, better to ask someone else to handle it, otherwise Ketu is headless warrior and you will damage that are yourself, e.g., 4th house Ketu - these people do not want anyone outside their family to contact them, so what they will do is to keep a secretary who will deal with them - i.e. she is the first one to handle them, and this person henadles them through his secretary**
**So what Ketu and dog means is that you don *not* deal with these areas directly**
**What if Ketu is in the Ascendant? That's why the Lal Kitab says take someone else's advice**
***Wherever* Ketu is, do not use your head, let someone else do it for you - DO NOT GO AHEAD AND DEAL DIRECTLY WITH PEOPLE IN WHICHEVR AREA YOUR KETU IS**
